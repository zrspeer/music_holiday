    Are you, too, spiritually exhausted by the cruelly predictable algorithms of
    the Spotify overlords? Do you miss the giddy anticipation of hitting play on
    a carefully curated mixtape filled with lyrical innuendo courtesy of your
    middle-school crush? Do you pine for days of burning CDs and the permanence
    of handwritten Sharpie titles? If you think that streaming is starting to
    ruin your relationship with music, let’s rebel and get out of this musical
    rut together. This holidazzle season Zach and I are sending out a different
    kind of holiday card: a collaborative mixtape built from songs hand-picked
    from our friends, loved ones, and at least one random stranger with
    excellent taste. Lace up your Heely’s and help us say “happy holidays and
    fuck-you very much” to the robots: Send us your songs and your mailing
    address. We’ve got a few prompts to get those synapses firing.
